        Since it's your bithday today, it seems customary to have a photo album somewhere here. This contains all of your pictures we could get our hands on. We seriously hope that looking at them will at least make you smile if not more. So go ahead, click on the link. Cheers! (PS: I don't know why but it's showing only the first four pictures, some problem with the code. Could not fix it. But you get the idea... :P)

        Also since Aman was involved in designing this site, it would be a shame if minions were not involved.<img src="http://emoticons4u.com/happy/045.gif"/>

        This is where we should write something touching which would make you all emotional. But as you know how pathetic we are at all that, We would just pretend that we worte something emotional here. [Emotional content goes here]. Now that we are done with that we would like to terminate the site. Oh No! Forgot to wish you. So, A very happy birthday to you. Since studies show that having more birthdays makes you live longer, we hope that you keep having them.
