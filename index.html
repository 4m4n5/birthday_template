        Since its your bithday today, it seems customary to have a photo album somewhere here. This contains all of your pictures we could get our hands on. I seriously hope that looking at them will atleast make you smile if not more. So go ahead, click on the link. Cheers! (ps: i dont know why but its showing only the first four pictures, some problem with the code. Could not fix it. But you get the idea... :-P)

        This is where we should write something touching which would make you all emotional. But as you know how pathetic we are at all that, We would just pretend that we worte something emotional here. [emotional content goes here]. Now that we are done with that, let me tell you why i took the pain to create all this on your birthday. Sometimes when i think about you, i wonder how can someone be so great at being great. Like i have told you, you are really the best person i have ever met in my life, and i doubt that i would ever meet someone half as good as you. So, whatever i do for you will always be a fraction to how much grateful i am that i met you. Happy Birthday Vatsala. I hope that this year you get everything you wish for and having said that i seriosly hope that you wish that i get a good CGPA :-P. I wish that you get happier with everyday that comes ahead.
